# A Mini-Essay on Mini-Essays

I used to be a staunch hater of writing, writing of any kind.

Writing was a form of education that I never appreciated, even at a very young age. The idea of sharing any personal information and exposing my unfiltered thoughts on a piece of paper just didn't provide me the security and comfort that I needed to feel. That is, not until I actually got to writing academically on the topics that A) never had to be read by anyone beside the professor, and B) I didn't need to see it again after a grade was announced. The subject that really sparked my interest in writing was philosophy (beyond the 101, beyond the rigorous treatment of logic). I love to think about philosophical positions based on human nature, morals and ethics, and professional ethics. Sometimes I would find myself writing for a class to fill the x-page quota and later exceeding even the maximum length the professors would even want to read and grade. Thus, a wannabe writer was made.

Recently, I discovered mini-essays from watching endless hours of YouTube. The concept of mini-essays is really simple. Follow these three rules and it should be relative easy.

1. Each mini-essay address one and only one topic.
2. Each mini-essay is short, with a word range of `200 ≤ x ≤ 500`. The entirety of the content should fit on a laptop screen.
3. The mini-essays should be organized.

There are several benefits of writing mini-essays, claimed by the videos I watched. Though I have not written enough to experience any of them, so I decided to leave it out of this essay.

Finally, each of my essays would be published on my blog. If you are reading this, the chances are, you have already found my blog and have began exploring it. If that is the case all I can say is have fun and happy reading. That's it, the end.
