# A Mini Essay About Me, A README of Sort

I am a recent college graduate franticly searching/applying for a job.

I recently graduated from a university with _B.S Computer Science_ degree, a concentration in Data Science and a minor in Mathematics. Now, I am ready to step into the big leagues. However, I quickly found myself to be the perfect embodiment of the saying "the day you graduate from college is the day your are out of a job". In conjunction with the fact that I had discovered my future calling much too late into my college career(right around the time of graduation).

In an IoT(Internet of Things) class, I discovered a fondness for setting up hardware and fixing problems. Given this, I would like to find systems administration related jobs where I will likely spend my foreseeable future putting together servers, patching internet from station to station, and sweeping in to save the day when someone inevitably "break" their computer.

This is me, in the most computer science fashion, an introduction of myself be done in a `README.md`. This will be the first of my many entries into my blog, which is just a glorified collection of my two cents on the world.

Stay Tuned
